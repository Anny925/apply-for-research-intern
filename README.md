This is a function I wrote for homework in last semester. The function is used to pricing American vanilla options with explicit difference scheme for transformed Black-Scholes PDE. The output c and p are the prices of call and put options respectively, c_delta and p_dejlat are the option delta's for call and put respectively. The input S0 is the initial stock price, X is the strike price, r is the interest rate, T is the terminal time, sigma is volatility, N is number of time step, dx is the step size in x, and [xmin,xmax] gives the truncated domain for the variable x, where x is log of stock price.
